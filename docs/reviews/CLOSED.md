# Closed, refuted and settled — read this BEFORE measuring or flagging

`2026-08-31-ts-audit.md` is append-only and 23,000 lines. It records **what was decided**, in the
order it was decided, which makes "has this already been closed?" expensive to answer and easy to
get wrong. This file is the answer to that question.

Three times in one session a pass re-derived something already closed (items **246**, **247**,
**257**). Each time the pass _did_ search first and searched the **wrong store**. So:

| the kind of fact you want                 | where it lives                                                                                                                  |

| "has this perf lever been tried?"         | **this file**, then the audit item it cites                                                                                     |
| "what does ISO say about X?"              | the session notes, then `../conformance/references.md` — **not** the audit, which holds the decision X blocks, not the evidence |
| "what did that measurement actually say?" | the audit item that measured it                                                                                                 |
| "is this semantics settled?"              | **this file**, §2                                                                                                               |

The audit's own rule is quoted in several items as _"CHECK THE REFUTED LIST before measuring"_.
**Until now there was no such list** — that absence is what the three re-derivations have in
common. Keep this file current: when an item refutes a lever or settles a question, add the line
here in the same commit.

## 1. Refuted perf levers — DO NOT RE-MEASURE

Each of these was built or priced and **rejected with numbers**. Re-attempting one costs a tick and
produces the same answer.

| **Mutating a guard that sits BEHIND other layers, as a single point**              | **REPORTS VACUITY, NOT DEADNESS — and the two look identical.** Item 270's rewrite is gated on `e.kind !== 'or'`; the mutant removing that gate SURVIVES, because `uniformEqChain`'s `flatten` descends only `or`, so an `xor` arrives as one branch and is rejected twice more.

Nothing to port. Item 267 measured the opposite at 100 terms (chain 15.25ms against 5.76), so the crossover is between 33 and 100 and **the `<= 32` gate is approximately AT it — deliberately not tuned**, since ~1.3x on an uncommon length risks the 2.6x case and would need a proper term-count sweep at one N.                                                                              | **271**, cf. 267, 270                      |

### Clean negatives — coverage added, no bug found

Worth knowing so the same ground is not re-probed hopefully:

- **Subquery predicates under `NOT` / `OR` / `NOT (… AND …)`** — 11 seeds, zero divergences (255).
- **`ALL SHORTEST`** and the other selectors — 15/15 on a fixture built with ties (255).
- **`{n}` vs `{n,n}`, `{n,}` vs `+`/`*`, an undirected quantified hop, a quantified hop composed
  with another segment** — 76/76, compared _within_ each engine as well as across (256).

**The pattern across nine priced areas:** the four that found bugs were all **semantics attached to
a quantified path** (which hop a predicate gates, which repetition a `WHERE` belongs to, what a
closing hop costs). The five clean ones were all **syntax and shape**. Price a gap where each engine
_decides_ something independently, not another unspelled form.

## 3. Stale claims — recorded once, no longer true

- **`eval_vec`** — gone (see §1).
- **`query-parallelization-and-simd`** — describes the deleted `lenke-core`; the engine is
  single-threaded. Priors may transfer, the numbers do not.
- **Item 197's "left for a decision"** — superseded by item 200's refutation and item 247's
  confirmation. The audit's later summary still lists it as open; it is not.
- **"`compilePredicate` lifts equality conjuncts into `props`"** — it does not; it compiles what it
  is given. Corrected twice before it stuck (items 209 → 210).
- **"The hop budget mirrors the TS matcher exactly"** — was false for `k > 1`; fixed at 254, and
  still false for the lean count walker (see §4).

| **Does the static boolean-context check cover INLINE PATTERN predicates?** | Today: TS **no**, the engine **partly** — it applies to whatever lowers to a `Plan::Filter`, which an inline predicate on a quantified-path endpoint (`->*(n WHERE …)`, `ANY SHORTEST`) does and one on a plain node pattern does not. That asymmetry is the registry's only remaining entry (~1 per 120,000 generated queries, `E_INVALID_VALUE` vs an EMPTY result). **Extending TS's walk to cover them was tried and measured WORSE** (1 divergence a run → 7, because the engine answers rows for `(n WHERE CAST(x AS STRING))`). Covering them in BOTH engines would reject queries that answer today, so it is a conformance decision. Item 259. |

### The `{k: null}` matrix, and the thing it corrects

Measured 2026-10-08 on a three-state fixture — a value, a stored **present** null, and an
**absent** key — in both engines. All ten spellings agree between the engines, so nothing here is
a divergence; it is one shared conformance question.

| spelling                                      | matches                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `MATCH (n:P {k: null})`                       | stored-null **and** absent |
| `WHERE n.k IS NULL`                           | stored-null **and** absent |
| `WHERE n.k = null`                            | nothing                    |
| `WHERE n.k IS NOT NULL`                       | value                      |
| `WHERE property_exists(n, k)`                 | value **and** stored-null  |
| `WHERE NOT property_exists(n, k)`             | absent                     |

| `MATCH (n:P {k: 1})` / `WHERE n.k = 1`        | value (the two agree)      |

Two things follow, and the second corrects how this question has been framed since item 180.

1. **Nothing is inexpressible.** `property_exists(n, k) AND n.k IS NULL` isolates the stored null
   on its own, and `NOT property_exists` isolates the absent key. So whichever way `{k: null}`
   goes, a user who needs the distinction has an exact spelling for it — the inline form is
   convenience, not the only access to the three states.
2. ~~**The 1.16x**~~ — **GONE as an argument entirely, by item 260 (2026-10-09), and the 1.16x
   itself did not reproduce.** This file already said the perf question was separable and that
   item 210's second route (an entry carrying expression-equality semantics) would unblock it
   under either semantics. That route is now **taken**: the `eqProps` loop rejects a null
   right-hand side, which makes a lifted entry mean `n.k = v` rather than `{k: v}`, so a `$param`
   needs no compile-time decision — and `compileNode` now passes an own-var, which it never did,
   so the general scan path lifts at all. **But HEAD's real spelling gap on a 200,000-vertex
   `User` fixture is 7.3%, not 16%**, so the recorded 1.16x was fixture-specific; the lift pays
   **0.944x** on clause `WHERE` with a flat control. Nothing about `{k: null}` is waiting on perf,
   and nothing about perf is waiting on `{k: null}`.

What is genuinely at stake, then, is only: conformance (ISO specifies this and we cannot choose;
the prose direction points at "matches nothing", so the current behaviour is a bet), and the
collision with the project's own rule that **a null is a stored, present value distinct from
absence** — `{k: null}` is the one place in a pattern where that distinction is erased.

## 5. Open — unblocked and priced

- ~~**A multi-value seed only fired for a WHOLE predicate**~~ — **CLOSED by item 264**
  (2026-10-09), at **56-93x**. `WHERE k IN [..] AND other > 5` with only `k` indexed cost **69x**
  the same `IN` alone, because `seed_from_conjuncts` picks one conjunct and `Seed` had no
  multi-value variant. The new rung sits BELOW an indexed eq/range (one selective seek beats a
  union, and that order leaves every existing plan untouched) and ABOVE the unindexed-eq fallback
  (whose "seek" is a column scan). **Mutant C1 survived all 1015 tests before three tests were
  added — the second time in one session that a new planner rung turned out to be unreached by
  `rewrite_fuzz`'s generator.**
- ~~**Neither engine seeds from a same-key `=`-OR-chain**~~ — **CLOSED by item 263** (2026-10-09),
  at **115-269x** in the TS engine. `collectHints` descended only `and`, so `k IN [a,b]` seeded
  (item 184) and `k = a OR k = b` scanned — one of the spelling pairs `CLAUDE.md` names among the
  100-300x seeding gaps. Found by grepping the pattern across engines right after item 261 closed
  it in Rust. A residual stays, measured and recorded: `OR` 33 is **2.68x** the `IN` spelling
  because the surviving rows re-check O(terms) where `IN` is one hashed test — below
  `spelling_probe`'s own 1ms floor, so not yet worth the evaluator rewrite.
  It widened to 10.36x at 33 terms / 27.74x at 100 once item 268 hashed `IN` (an uncaptured win,
  not a regression — the OR spelling never changed), and is now **CLOSED by item 270 at 29.3x**:
  a uniform same-key `=`-chain is lowered to the hashed membership test in `compileExpr`, so the
  two spellings land within 6% at every length. Sound because `uniformEqChain` admits only
  `prop <=> const` operands, none of which can raise — so collapsing them does not conflict with
  the `or` arm's deliberate no-short-circuit rule — and because the equivalence is exact in
  three-valued logic (a null needle → UNKNOWN both ways; a NULL term leaves a hit TRUE and makes
  a miss UNKNOWN, which is what `hasNull` encodes). Applied in `compileExpr` rather than to the
  AST so `collectHints`' own seeding still sees the original `or`.
  **A note on the probe:** `spelling_probe` reported "no group over 2x" throughout, because its
  `OR vs IN` group is **2 terms**, where the ratio really was 1.19x — **a probe group's SIZE is
  part of what it can see.**
- ~~**Native never index-SEEDS from `IN`**~~ — **CLOSED by item 261** (2026-10-09), at **65-75x**,
  and the recorded price was wrong three ways. It was carried as a "residual 3.3x 32→33 cliff"
  needing "a multi-value `Seed` variant plus a physical operator, with row-order/byte-identity
  work". Measured before building: **the cliff is 1.03x** (item 185's membership set already
  flattened it), **an `=`-OR-chain does not multi-seek either** (`IN` 33 and OR 33 cost the same,
  1.00x — so the ≤32 rewrite bought a cheaper evaluator form and no seed), and **no new operator
  was needed** because `Plan::Union { all: true }` already concatenates without deduping, so a
  union tree of the existing `IndexSeek` is the whole change. Row order changes, which is
  unspecified and already true of the single-value seek, so there was no byte-identity work either.
  **Re-price a carried number before building against it.**
- ~~**The REVERSED AND spelling**~~ — **CLOSED by item 259** (2026-10-09). `WHERE <raising> AND
<seekable>` now answers the same in both engines. It did NOT need TS to replicate the seeding or
  native to drop it, which is what this entry assumed and priced as "not perf-neutral": a filter
  keeps only a clean TRUE, so conjunct order is unobservable there and the conjuncts that cannot
  raise simply go first. The entry was also right that nothing guarded it — being an error against
  a NON-EMPTY result, the registry could never have declared it, so closing it was the only
  available route. Items 115, 174, 258, 259.
- ~~**An INLINE `IN` list costs 2.7x the PARAM spelling**~~ — **CLOSED by item 267** (2026-10-09),
  at **11.9x at 500 items**, and the spelling gap is now 1.00x at every length. Item 266 had
  measured the gap correctly (100 items: 15.13ms inline against 5.74ms param, the param spelling
  FLAT across 33→100) and named the wrong cause: not `try_filter_keep` but **the GQL PARSER**,
  which desugared `IN <list literal>` into an OR-chain of ANY length. One `eprintln` settled it —
  for the inline spelling the evaluator's `Expr::In` arm is never reached at all. That also
  explains 266's no-op fold: the parser had already consumed every inline list, so
  `normalize_pred` never saw one. The fix caps the chain at **`IN_CHAIN_MAX = 32`**, deliberately
  the same line `normalize_pred` draws, **and folds a long all-literal list to `Lit(List)`** so
  `in_set` serves it. **Both halves are load-bearing:** capping alone measured **172.98ms at 33
  items against 5.18ms**, because `in_set` declines a non-`Lit` haystack and `eval` then broadcasts
  the list across the batch — item 185's defect re-created by a change meant to fix it. Items 266,
  **267**.
- ~~**The TS engine's `IN` is a linear scan, per row**~~ — **CLOSED by item 268** (2026-10-09), at
  **34.7x** on the inline spelling at 500 items and 10.7x on the `$param` one. Found by grepping
  item 267's pattern across engines: TS had no `in_set` equivalent at all, and `case 'list'` also
  rebuilt an inline haystack with an element closure call PER ROW, so the inline spelling cost
  3.07x the param one at every length. A closed all-literal haystack is now hashed at compile
  time and a `$param` one memoized on its array identity; both curves are flat in list length and
  the two spellings agree within 12%. Whitelist is deliberately the Rust `in_set` one, because
  `Set.has` is SameValueZero and `structuralEq` ends at `===`: they differ on **NaN alone**, so
  NaN elements keep the linear scan. **One honest negative: 0.95x on the param spelling at 8
  items** — a threshold like the Rust side's `IN_CHAIN_MAX` was declined on purpose, since the
  hashed path wins at 32+ on both spellings and at 8 on the inline one, so a threshold would buy
  ~5% on the shortest param lists at the price of a new length boundary.
  **Item 269 then had to fix what 268 broke next door:** the ARRAY-IDENTITY key it cached on
  missed every row for an inline list of params, because `case 'list'` rebuilds that array per
  row — a 2.9x regression on a sibling spelling, found by pricing all three spellings rather than
  by any failure. Re-keyed on a per-execution `execEpoch` (hash only a `closedList` haystack,
  whose value cannot depend on the row), all three spellings now agree within ~14% at every
  length, and the inline-param one is **24.2x faster than it was before 268 ever landed.**
- ~~**TS `SET`'s O(width)**~~ — **CLOSED BY DESIGN.** Item 147 removed one of the three O(K)
  passes; the other two are inherent to the frozen immutable bag (a single-key write must build a
  new object and freeze it, and the freeze is what makes a stray mutation throw). Do not "fix" it
  without replacing that design. Items 147, 148, confirmed 266.
- **`addVertex`** — the single target behind the three `bench:usage` rows TS loses, all a 3.7x
  constant factor (§1). Reopening means arguing with item 203's conclusion, with numbers.
- Nothing else in the TS **query** surface is above 5x once the adjacency floor is accounted for
  (item 197's closing line, still accurate).

## 6. Consequences of the AND decision — RESOLVED by item 258, and not as predicted

This section was written before the change and asked three questions. All three are now answered by
measurement, and **two of its three guesses were wrong.** Kept rather than rewritten, because the
wrong guesses are the useful part: each was a plausible inference from "`AND` now short-circuits"
that the engine did not bear out.

| the question §6 asked                                                  | the answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Item 190's placement rule — is a subquery conjunct free to reorder? | **No, and the guard is now MORE load-bearing.** `opt.rs`'s `can_raise` declines the US008/UA004 latitude for relocation; short-circuiting makes that a correctness condition rather than a courtesy, because relocating a raising conjunct EARLIER would make it raise where the written order skips it.                  |
| 2. Item 175's divergence — does it become the intended behaviour?      | **No — it is what is LEFT.** The hop seed gate's cheap-conjunct-first ordering is a reordering the TS engine has no seek to match, so it is now one of the two surviving routes in the registry entry.                                                                                                                    |
| 3. The registry entry — delete it?                                     | **NARROWED, not deleted.** _§6 said "it should be **deleted**, not widened"; that was written before measuring and it was wrong._ Traffic on the differential fuzzer at 20,000 queries a run went from **~4 uses to ~1**. Two routes survive, both about ORDER rather than the connective — see the entry's own `reason`. |

**What the change also exposed**, which §6 did not anticipate at all: the two engines had been
agreeing on `WHERE … AND VALUE { … RETURN count(*) }` **by two different routes** — native rejecting
it statically at plan time, TS catching it per row — both as `E_INVALID_VALUE`, so nothing noticed.
Short-circuiting removed TS's route and the agreement with it. Fixed by giving TS's
`definitelyNonBool` the `valueSubquery` arm it never had: **a static reject is order-independent, so
it is the route that survives short-circuiting.**

The generalisable lesson, which is why this stays in `CLOSED.md` rather than only in the audit:
**two engines returning the same error code are not necessarily implementing the same rule.** Any
change that removes one engine's path to an error can reveal that the other's was the only real one.
