# service map — the vertical slice

A live **service-dependency map**: ~240 services across 4 clusters, `CALLS` edges between them, one editable `status` column. It exists to thread a single feature through every layer at once — React → `createSyncClient` → SharedWorker (`wasm` engine + OPFS + `createSyncEngine`) → WebSocket → Node server (`@lenke/node` addon + `createSyncHost`).

```
Tab(s) — dumb <table> over useSyncExternalStore
  └─ createSyncClient ── MessagePort ──► SharedWorker (one store per origin)
                                           ├─ wasm engine + createStore
                                           ├─ OPFS snapshot (warm boot, queue survival)
                                           ├─ createSyncEngine
                                           │    ├─ collections per cluster (scope tokens)
                                           │    └─ upstream: reconnecting WS
                                           └─ engine.createHost per tab port
Node server — @lenke/node addon, whole fleet, createSyncHost per socket
```

## Run it

```sh
# once: build the engine artifacts
bun run --cwd ../../packages/native build:wasm     # lenke_core.wasm
cd ../../packages/node && bunx napi build --platform --release --esm && cd -

bun run server    # terminal 1 → ws://localhost:8787
bun run dev       # terminal 2 → vite; open the printed URL (Chrome first: SharedWorker + OPFS)
```

Headless check without a browser: `bun run smoke` (spawns the real Node server, drives it with a protocol client over a real socket).

## The three demos

1. **Live everywhere** — open two tabs, pick a cluster, flip a service to `down` in one tab; the other updates instantly (one SharedWorker store, one host per tab, epoch-routed pushes). Click `?` → **blast radius** lists everything transitively upstream of the victim.
2. **Demand-fill** — switch to a cluster you haven't visited: `loading…` renders from `complete: false`, the worker fetches that cluster from the server (scope-token collections), rows land, `complete` flips.
3. **Pull the cable** — kill the server (Ctrl-C terminal 1). Edits still apply instantly and the status line counts unsynced changes. **Reload the tab while offline** — the OPFS snapshot warm-boots the store with your queued edits intact. Restart the server — the queue drains, counter hits 0.

## Findings (the point of the slice)

- **Reconnect helper — now in the library** — this example's server link used to be a ~40-line hand-rolled reconnecting client; it's now `createReconnectingClient` (re-dial with back-off, re-subscribe on reconnect, park writes while offline). The worker's whole transport is the `connect` callback — open a socket, wire its lifecycle. Durable writes still belong to the engine's queue, not the helper.
- **Value-scoped collections are first-class now** — one `services` collection declares `key: 'cluster'`, and the engine tracks completeness and demand-fill per bound value, reading it straight off the subscription's `$cluster` param. The former synthetic `cluster:<name>` token threaded through the deps channel is gone — no parallel namespace of magic strings, and the scope rides the real (first-class) params path.
- **Gremlin rides the wire — one-shot AND live** — a `query` with `lang: 'gremlin'` runs a one-shot traversal → `values` (`client.gremlin(traversal)`); a `subscribe` with `lang: 'gremlin'` is a **standing** traversal whose snapshot carries `values`, re-run under the same declared-`deps` gating (`store.liveGremlin`). Full values each push — keyed diffs are a rows notion and don't apply. The blast radius stays native **GQL** var-length (`-[:CALLS]->{1,}` + `DISTINCT`) because GQL covers it, but imperative traversals now cross the same protocol both ways. Gremlin has no engine param binding, so values interpolate via the **`gremlin` tag / `escapeGremlin`** — `${v}` is escaped into a safe literal, so ``client.gremlin`g.V().has('name', ${userInput})` `` is injection-safe (proven inert against a `drop()` injection).
- **Cold boot from empty bytes was an FFI fault** — fixed in `@lenke/native` (`graphFromNdjson` now treats empty input as an empty graph).
- **Status is a subscription now** — the host already pushed `status` on every queue/connectivity change; the client wakes `onStatus` subscribers on each, so `StatusBar` is `useSyncExternalStore(client.onStatus, client.getStatus)` with no interval (the former 1 s poll is gone).
- **Keyed diffs now, Arrow later** — the grid subscribes with `key: 's.sid'`, so a status flip re-ships one cell (`patch`), not the whole cluster's rows; the client applies patch/remove/order onto its retained rows and keeps unchanged rows' identity. A subscription without a `key` still gets full `rows` (aggregates need that). Arrow-buffer transfer — the orthogonal win for large _bulk_ loads, not churn — remains the next byte-efficiency step.
