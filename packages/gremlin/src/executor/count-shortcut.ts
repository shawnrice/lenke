 * `g.…count()` answered from the graph's counters instead of by enumerating.

 * The GQL surface has had this family since audit items 95/99/112/114/125/129 —
 * `MATCH (n:Person) RETURN count(*)` is 0.0ms there. The Gremlin surface is a
 * separate TypeScript implementation and never got it, so the same question
 * spelled `g.V().hasLabel('Person').count()` enumerated 200,000 vertices and took
 * 57.5ms (audit item 130, which measured the surface for the first time).
 *
 * Deliberately NARROW. Every shape here is one the graph already keeps a counter
 * or a bucket for, so the shortcut is a read rather than a cheaper walk; anything
 * else returns `undefined` and runs normally. A shortcut that half-answers a shape
 * is a wrong answer, and these are the shapes whose answer is exactly a size.
